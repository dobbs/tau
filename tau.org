* maybe separate the state (angle, x, y) from the instructions (move, turn)
** instructions would take a turtle or bale, a source for units, and a strategy?
** or maybe the turtle or bale would hold the strategy for responding to move, turn
** or maybe the structure is more flat?  moveTogether vs moveEach.
** I LIKE THE FUNCTIONAL ABSTRACTION THIS WAY
   - turtle can be just {angle, x, y} -- and penColor, lineWeight, or other state
   - maybe the functions can change only one state element (in which case move needs {xy:[x, y]})
   - or move is the only special case... it needs to know the angle and the previous position
   - or turn must set dx=cos(angle), dy=sin(angle) on the state

* how should turtles be named?
** the main trick is naming bales
** move(turtle, source)
   var new = $.extend(true, {}, turtle);
   var strategy = turtle.strategy();
   strategy.move(new, source.angle(), source.scalar());
